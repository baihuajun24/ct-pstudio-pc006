# PC006 Autodesk-urban-mobility

Hi! We are a group of Cornell Tech students working on our course TECH 5900 Product Studio. We work with Autodesk to answer the problem of "How might we address the problem of urban mobility by designing a single person, environmentally conscious, human powered transportation equipment?" in the fall semester of 2017.
